Compoents 
global: Header , NavBar , SideBar
notes...
if i want to provide an context api .... i should provide it ...to App.js not any smaller componets 
you can not use style attribute on componets

to read a local json file ....put the file inside the public folder 
then do the fetching


if the erroe was SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', "<"!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON ..."
then the respone of the fetching is html or XML file XXXX


we use AnimatePresence so we can see our animate fade out 
we give our parent route a unique key using the locationpathname from my current loaction
when evey my key changes our route become a new compoent ...so AnimatePresence makes react wait for all the animations are done .. then the component unmounts



note ... never put a stracture of the pages withthe routes.... only put the routes and maybe nav and footer ... nothing eles
